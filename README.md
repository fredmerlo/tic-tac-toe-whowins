# Flat Array TicTacToe Evaluation
## Why...? Because interview code challenge
Built from scratch with vanilla JS, NodeJS-12 and Jest, no other dependencies.

### Code provided AS-IS
- Happy Path code implementation
- Look at the Jest tests to see how it works
- No support (ain't nobody got time for that)
- Have the fun  :D
