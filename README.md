# Simple Array TicTacToe Evaluation
## Why...? Because interview code challenges are `LAME` and a `WASTE` of time
Built from scratch with vanilla JS, NodeJS-12 and Jest, no other dependencies.

The code uses a simple array with a single loop to evaluate a flattened 3x3 tic-tac-toe board.

No need for convoluted nested loops or funky logic.

### Code provided AS-IS
- Happy Path code implementation
- Look at the Jest tests to see how it works
- No support (ain't nobody got time for that)
- Have the fun  :D
